"""Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:"""

# Hayrunnisa Bıyıklı 21091010143

speed = 70  # Speed in miles per hour

time1 = 6
time2 = 10
time3 = 15

# Calculate distances
distance1 = speed * time1
distance2 = speed * time2
distance3 = speed * time3

# Display results
print("Distance traveled in", time1, "hours:", distance1, "miles")
print("Distance traveled in", time2, "hours:", distance2, "miles")
